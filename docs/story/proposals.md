# Epic Proposals

High‑impact additions to elevate scale, stakes, and spectacle while reinforcing core mechanics and narrative.

## Cinematic Setpieces
- Rooftop Billboard Domino: Chain‑hack ads across skyscrapers; falling billboards become moving cover during a chopper chase.
- Train‑Surf Heist: Escort a server car across multiple lines while fighting inside, on top of, and between trains.
- Citywide Laughquake: When Hype Meter maxes, the district ripples with color waves that stun enemies and open secret routes.
- Ad Zeppelin Hunt: Multi‑phase aerial battle—tether, reel, board, and rebrand the zeppelin mid‑air.
- Spire Blackout Finale: Turn off a desaturation reactor, plunging the city into darkness—then light it with memes as combat illumination.
- Mirror Garden Showdown: Fight Echo Hydraclone in a hall of reflective AR panes that duplicate silhouettes and telegraphs; shatter panes to reduce clone confusion.
- Content Court Collapse: Sector‑slice arena with rotating verdict lights; flip the PA and crowd‑chant down the Adjudicator.
- Broodstorm Burn: Ignite goo fields while surfing rising hazard waves; synchronized AoE clears create stunning color blooms.

## Boss Evolutions
- Commissioner Sanitizer (Phase 2): "PR Meltdown"—audience boos create windows; player amplifies crowd with punchlines to strip defenses.
- Brandfather (Phase 3): "Sponsor Exodus"—each destroyed ad pillar removes one of the boss’s mechanics; fans switch sides and grant buffs.
- The Algorithm (True Ending): "Paradox Choir"—call‑and‑response rhythm phases where correct meme tags counter boss prompts.
- Echo Hydraclone: "Fractal Bloom"—each generation gains speed but loses health; players can trigger a "Coherence Collapse" by tagging multiple clones with the same punchline within a window.
- Strike Adjudicator: "Hung Jury"—if enough crowd chants land during Verdict windup, immediate stagger and Strike removal.
- Broodmaker: "Swarm Disillusion"—killing broodlings near goo puddles accelerates decay and exposes dorsal weakpoint longer.

## World Systems Upgrades
- Saturation Meter (Global): District saturation grants tiered buffs (movement, crit chance, crowd summons). Drops when the player fails; persists via liberated hubs.
- Crowd Momentum: NPC crowds gather behind player performance, occasionally forming flash mobs that block enemy spawns or heal.
- Trendstorms 2.0: Add readable telegraphs and opt‑in modifiers for higher rewards (select storm flavor at mission start).
- Memefragment Sets: 3‑piece and 5‑piece set bonuses enable archetypes (Crit Clown, Tanky Troll, Support Satirist).

## Progression & Meta
- Remix Bench: Combine two punchlines into a hybrid Ultimate with a tradeoff (longer cooldown, larger radius).
- Community Contracts: Timed city objectives (e.g., "De‑brand 5 nodes in 10 minutes") that unlock cosmetic global changes.
- Liberation Milestones: At 25/50/75/100% city re‑saturation, unlock city‑wide events (parades, fireworks, easter eggs).

## Audio‑Visual Epicness
- Adaptive Score: Music shifts from mono to full spectrum with saturation; choir enters at Hype 3+.
- Crowd Callouts: Contextual chants synced to objective states; dynamic ducking so info remains clear.
- Color Ramping: Subtle bloom and chroma increase with combo; hard resets cause momentary grayscale shock.

## Social Resonance (In‑World)
- Graffiti Echoes: Player achievements appear as environmental stickers and wall art in later missions.
- Echo Shoutouts: NPCs reference memorable player feats (boss humiliation, speed clears) in ambient VO.

## Post‑Game Modes
- New Game Plus: Start with one memefragment set complete; enemies gain anti‑combo counters.
- Endless Broadcast: Wave survival with rotating trend modifiers; global leaderboard in the hub.

## Mission Epic Variants (Optional)
- M01: Add rooftop pursuit finale with relay toss between buildings.
- M02: Parallel trains with mid‑jump slow‑mo punchline window.
- M03: Crowd participation QTE to choose the roast angle (satire style gives different debuffs).
- M04: Zepp boarding action with rotating gravity ads.
- M04A: Courtroom sectors rotate faster during final Verdict; crowd chants force immediate phase break.
- M02A: Brood pits expand unless burned; synchronized AoE clears produce larger saturation bursts.
- M05: Hydraclone arena variant with destructible mirror panes and safe radii that suppress split attempts.
- M06: Logic rooms reflect player build (crit builds face timing puzzles; tank builds get attrition rooms).
- M07: Player chooses broadcast venues to protect; each venue adds a new community buff and a new spawn threat.

## Alignment With Mechanics
- Hype Meter fuels crowd momentum and saturation boons.
- Enemy Director uses crowd mobs as soft blockers and pacing valves.
- Trendstorms integrate with weather system and spawn patterns for readable but dramatic shifts.
- Set bonuses complement existing pickups and combo systems.
- Hydraclone split‑management pairs with AoE vs single‑target tradeoffs and score/hype diminishing returns.
- Strike Adjudicator integrates debuff management and node control into boss fairness.
- Broodmaker leverages add caps and hazard decay for readable pressure.
