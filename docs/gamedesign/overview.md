## Overview

**High concept**: Fast, readable, low-friction first-person shooter for the browser. Fight waves of simple "block bots" in a compact arena. The focus is on kinetic movement, immediate feedback, and sessions that start instantly.

**Pillars**
- **Clarity first**: Clean shapes, bold colors, obvious feedback (tracers, sparks, HUD).
- **Always moving**: Sprint, jump, subtle head‑bob; no heavy inventories or menus.
- **Instant action**: Pointer lock → enemies already spawning → go.
- **Replayable waves**: Simple scaling keeps sessions short and repeatable.

**Genre**: Arcade FPS (single‑player, wave survival)

**Platform**: Desktop web (modern browsers). Controls target keyboard + mouse.

**Session length**: 3–10 minutes per run.
