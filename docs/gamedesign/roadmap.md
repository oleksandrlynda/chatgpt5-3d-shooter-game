## Roadmap (initial)

### Near term
- Settings: mouse sensitivity, audio volume, invert‑Y, FOV slider
- Balance: wave size scaling curve, ammo economy, enemy DPS tuning
- Performance: object pooling for tracers/sparks; frustum culling tweaks

### Content
- Additional enemy types (ranged, tank, fast melee)
- Weapon variations (SMG, shotgun, marksman) with distinct roles
- Pickups: health, ammo drops, temporary powerups
- Spawn director: spawn points that respect player position/line‑of‑sight

### Systems
- Difficulty modes; score multipliers and streak bonuses
- Pause/settings menu in‑game; key‑rebinding
- Basic analytics (local only) for run stats and balance insight
