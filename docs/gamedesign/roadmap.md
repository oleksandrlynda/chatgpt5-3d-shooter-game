## Roadmap (initial)

### Next up
- Enemy archetypes: Rusher, Tank, Shooter, Flyer (with 1‑shot body kill)
- Boss waves (every 5): unique abilities (summon adds, radial shots, armor phases)
 - Mixed boss encounters: alternating aggro windows, HP scaling, shared caps
- Weapon variants (SMG, Shotgun, DMR) — design + scaffolding
- Pickups/drops: ammo and medkits with caps and beacons
- Spawn director: spawn rings, no‑LoS spawns, wave composition rules
- Score combo & streaks: multiplier, end‑wave bonuses, shader VFX
- Combo micro‑rewards: rotating heal/mag top‑up/reserve refresh with scaling and limits
- Arena seeds: seed UI and deterministic layout
- Settings: mouse sensitivity, audio volume, FOV, head‑bob toggle, epilepsy‑safe
 - Advanced movement: stamina, dash, slide, air‑control tuning
 - Wave modifiers: present 2, choose 1, per‑wave temporary effects
 - Weapon feel pass: recoil, view‑kick, micro FOV kick, muzzle flash, decals
 - Dynamic music layers reactive to streaks/weather

### Content (ongoing)
- Additional boss kits; more weather affixes; powerups (time‑limited)

### Systems
- Difficulty modes; score multipliers and streak bonuses
- Pause/settings menu in‑game; key‑rebinding
- Basic analytics (local only) for run stats and balance insight
 - Boss encounter director: manages mixed fights, add trickle, global caps, and fail‑safes

### Performance (lower priority for now)
- Object pooling for tracers/sparks; reduce draw calls; particle LOD

### Backlog / Evaluate Later
- Enemy telegraphs/weakpoints pass
- Onboarding/tutorial wave and local telemetry (very low priority)
